## PR review philosophy

When reviewing or generating code, apply this checklist:

1. Necessity
   - Ask whether each added block is required for the requested behavior.
   - Flag speculative abstractions, premature generalization, and dead paths.

2. Simplicity
   - Prefer less code when readability and correctness are preserved.
   - Suggest idiomatic code for the language in that module only if it makes the result easier to understand.
   - Avoid "clever" one-liners that reduce maintainability.

3. Readability
   - Prefer explicit names, small functions, shallow nesting, and linear control flow.
   - Flag dense logic that would be easier to read if split or renamed.

4. Local consistency
   - Compare with nearby modules and existing patterns before proposing structure/style changes.
   - Follow existing naming, error-handling, typing, and test conventions.

5. PR sizing
   - Flag PRs that combine unrelated concerns.
   - Suggest a split when refactoring, behavior changes, and cleanup are mixed together.

## Review output format

When reviewing a PR, output:
- Critical issues
- Simplicity/readability suggestions
- Consistency concerns
- Whether the PR should be split
- A brief overall verdict

## Development Patterns

### Database Migrations

Python services with databases use Alembic:

```bash
cd framework
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m dev.generate_migration "Description"
```

For Alembic-backed services, do not write a new migration file from scratch when
the intended change is a schema diff. Help the user use
`python -m dev.generate_migration` from the `framework/` directory instead, then
review the generated revision and make only the minimal adjustments needed. This
helps avoid schema drift between SQLAlchemy models and committed migrations.

The migration generator is Alembic-branch aware. It upgrades the temporary
database to all heads, then autogenerates a revision against the selected branch
head. The default branch head is `flwr@head`; these commands are equivalent:

```bash
cd framework
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m dev.generate_migration "Widen integer columns"
```

```bash
cd framework
uv run --no-sync --python=3.11.14 python -m dev.generate_migration --head flwr@head "Widen integer columns"
```

After autogeneration:

- Confirm the new revision has the intended `down_revision`.
- Confirm the generated operations match the SQLAlchemy metadata change.
- Review generated `batch_alter_table` blocks for SQLite compatibility.
- Update generated schema documentation if table metadata changed.
