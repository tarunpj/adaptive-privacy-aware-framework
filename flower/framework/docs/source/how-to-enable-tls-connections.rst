########################
 Enable TLS connections
########################

Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures the communication between endpoints is encrypted.
This guide describes how to establish secure TLS SuperLink ↔ SuperNodes as well as User
↔ SuperLink connections. It also explains how to enable TLS on the internal Runtime API
connections used by SuperExec, ``ServerApp`` processes, and ``ClientApp`` processes.

.. note::

    This guide builds on the Flower App setup presented in
    :doc:`how-to-run-flower-with-deployment-engine` guide and extends it to replace the
    use of ``--insecure`` in favour of TLS.

.. tip::

    Checkout the `Flower Authentication
    <https://github.com/flwrlabs/flower/tree/main/examples/supernode-authentication>`_
    example for a complete self-contained example on how to setup TLS and (optionally)
    node authentication. Check out the :doc:`how-to-authenticate-supernodes` guide to
    learn more about adding an authentication layer to SuperLink ↔ SuperNode
    connections.

**************
 Certificates
**************

Using TLS-enabled connections expects some certificates generated and passed when
launching the SuperLink, the SuperNodes and when a user (e.g. a data scientist that
wants to submit a ``Run``) interacts with the federation via the `flwr CLI
<ref-api-cli.html>`_. The same certificates can be used for local prototyping when
enabling TLS on internal Runtime API connections.

We have prepared a script that can be used to generate such set of certificates. While
using these is fine for prototyping, we advise you to follow the standards set in your
team/organization and to generate the certificates and share them with the corresponding
parties. Refer to the **Generate TLS certificates** section in the example linked at the
top of this guide.

.. code-block:: bash

    # In the example directory, generate the certificates
    $ python generate_creds.py

This will generate the TLS certificates in a new ``certificates/`` directory. Copy this
directory into the directory of your app (e.g. a directory generated earlier via ``flwr
new``).

.. warning::

    The approach for generating TLS certificates in the context of this example can
    serve as an inspiration and starting point, but it should not be used as a reference
    for production environments. Please refer to other sources regarding the issue of
    correctly generating certificates for production environments. For non-critical
    prototyping or research projects, it might be sufficient to use the self-signed
    certificates generated using the scripts mentioned in this guide. In production, do
    not reuse the same server certificate and private key for multiple services. A
    better practice is to use a unique key pair for each service, for example the
    SuperLink Fleet API, the SuperLink-hosted Runtime API, and each SuperNode-hosted
    Runtime API.

**********************************
 Launching the SuperLink with TLS
**********************************

This section describes how to launch a SuperLink that works on TLS-enabled connections.
The code snippet below assumes the `certificates/` directory is in the same directory
where you execute the command from. Edit the paths accordingly if that is not the case.
When providing certificates for the Fleet API and Control API, the SuperLink expects a
tuple of three certificates paths: CA certificate, server certificate and server private
key. The same command can also provide AppIo-named certificates for the SuperLink's
Runtime API.

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2,3,4,5,6,7

    $ flower-superlink \
        --ssl-ca-certfile certificates/ca.crt \
        --ssl-certfile certificates/server.pem \
        --ssl-keyfile certificates/server.key \
        --appio-ssl-ca-certfile certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-ssl-certfile certificates/server.pem \
        --appio-ssl-keyfile certificates/server.key

.. dropdown:: Understand the command

    * ``--ssl-ca-certfile``: Specify the location of the CA certificate file in your file. This file is a certificate that is used to verify the identity of the SuperLink.
    * | ``--ssl-certfile``: Specify the location of the SuperLink's TLS certificate file. This file is used to identify the SuperLink and to encrypt the packages that are transmitted over the network.
    * | ``--ssl-keyfile``: Specify the location of the SuperLink's TLS private key file. This file is used to decrypt the packages that are transmitted over the network.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-ca-certfile``: Specify the location of the CA certificate file used by SuperExec to verify the SuperLink's Runtime API server certificate.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-certfile``: Specify the location of the Runtime API server TLS certificate file.
        The certificate must include Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the Runtime API address used by
        SuperExec. When using an IP address such as ``127.0.0.1``, the certificate must include a
        matching IP SAN.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-keyfile``: Specify the location of the Runtime API server TLS private key file.

.. _connecting-the-supernodes-with-tls:

************************************
 Connecting the SuperNodes with TLS
************************************

This section describes how to launch a SuperNode that works on TLS-enabled connections.
The code snippet below assumes the `certificates/` directory is in the same directory
where you execute the command from. To secure the SuperNode ↔ SuperLink connection,
replace ``--insecure`` with ``--root-certificates``. The same command can also provide
AppIo-named certificates for the SuperNode's Runtime API.

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2,3,4,5

    $ flower-supernode \
        --root-certificates certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-ssl-ca-certfile certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-ssl-certfile certificates/server.pem \
        --appio-ssl-keyfile certificates/server.key \
        --superlink 127.0.0.1:9092 \
        --clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9094 \
        --node-config="partition-id=0 num-partitions=2"

.. dropdown:: Understand the command

    * ``--root-certificates``: This specifies the location of the CA certificate file. The ``ca.crt`` file is used to verify the identity of the SuperLink.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-ca-certfile``: Specify the location of the CA certificate file used by SuperExec to verify the SuperNode's Runtime API server certificate.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-certfile``: Specify the location of the Runtime API server TLS certificate file.
        The certificate must include Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the Runtime API address used by
        SuperExec. When using an IP address such as ``127.0.0.1``, the certificate must include a
        matching IP SAN.
    * | ``--appio-ssl-keyfile``: Specify the location of the Runtime API server TLS private key file.

Follow the same procedure, i.e. replacing ``--insecure`` with ``--root-certificates``,
to launch the second SuperNode.

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2,3,4,5

    $ flower-supernode \
        --root-certificates certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-ssl-ca-certfile certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-ssl-certfile certificates/server.pem \
        --appio-ssl-keyfile certificates/server.key \
        --superlink 127.0.0.1:9092 \
        --clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9095 \
        --node-config="partition-id=1 num-partitions=2"

At this point, you have successfully launched a SuperLink and two SuperNodes with
TLS-enabled connections.

.. note::

    The ``--appio-ssl-*`` Runtime API TLS options configure server-authenticated TLS.
    They do not configure mutual TLS. The ``--appio-ssl-ca-certfile`` file is used by
    SuperExec and app processes to verify the Runtime API server certificate, not as a
    client certificate. If Runtime API TLS is not configured, internal Runtime API
    connections remain unencrypted and should stay inside a trusted network.

*************************************************************
 TLS for Runtime API Connections in "Process" Isolation Mode
*************************************************************

For details about SuperExec, "process" isolation mode, and "subprocess" isolation mode,
see :doc:`ref-flower-network-communication`.

So far, we've been showing you how to enable TLS for Runtime API connections when using
the default "subprocess" isolation mode. In this mode, SuperLink and SuperNode
automatically start their SuperExecs with the correct Runtime API TLS options. However,
if you want to run SuperExec separately in "process" isolation mode, you need to do a
few things differently to enable TLS for the Runtime API connections.

First, we need to launch the SuperLink and SuperNode with ``--isolation=process`` and
with the Runtime API TLS options. This tells the SuperLink and SuperNode that the
SuperExecs will be launched separately, e.g. by an operator or orchestration system.
Next, in order for the SuperExecs to establish TLS connections to the Runtime APIs, we
need to provide the Runtime API TLS options when launching the SuperExecs. Below is an
example command to launch a SuperExec that can establish TLS connections to the Runtime
API hosted by the SuperLink:

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    $ flower-superexec \
        --root-certificates certificates/ca.crt \
        --appio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9091 \
        --plugin-type serverapp

.. dropdown:: Understand the command

    * ``--root-certificates``: Specify the location of the CA certificate file. The ``ca.crt`` file is used by SuperExec to verify the Runtime API server certificate.
    * | ``--appio-api-address``: Specify the address of the Runtime API that SuperExec should connect to. In this example, ``127.0.0.1:9091`` is the SuperLink's Runtime API.
    * | ``--plugin-type``: Specify the type of app process SuperExec should launch. Use ``serverapp`` for a ``ServerApp`` SuperExec.

Next, use the same procedure for a ``ClientApp`` SuperExec, but pass the SuperNode's
Runtime API address, e.g. ``127.0.0.1:9094``, and set ``--plugin-type clientapp``.

Now your SuperLink-side SuperExec and SuperNode-side SuperExec can establish TLS
connections to their respective Runtime APIs. When using "process" isolation mode, it is
the responsibility of the process launcher (e.g. user or orchestrator) to launch the
SuperExecs with the correct Runtime API TLS options. If you use an orchestration system
to launch the SuperExecs, make sure to include the Runtime API TLS options in the
commands or configuration used by your orchestration system.

************************
 TLS-enabled Flower CLI
************************

The `Flower CLI <ref-api-cli.html>`_ (e.g. ``flwr run`` command) is the way a user (e.g.
a data scientist) can interact with a deployed federation. The Flower CLI commands are
processed by the SuperLink and therefore, if it has been configured to only operate on
TLS conenction, the requests sent by the Flower CLI need to make use of a TLS
certificate. To do so, replace the ``insecure = true`` field in your Flower
Configuration TOML file with a new field that reads the certificate:

.. code-block:: toml
    :caption: config.toml
    :emphasize-lines: 3,3

    [superlink.local-deployment]
    address = "127.0.0.1:9093"
    root-certificates = "/absolute/path/to/certificates/ca.crt"

Note that the path to the ``root-certificates`` is relative to the root of the project.
Now, you can run the example by executing ``flwr run``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flwr run . local-deployment --stream

.. tip::

    You can setup your ``local-deployment`` profile as the default so you don't have to
    specify it in every Flower CLI command that needs to connect to the SuperLink. For
    that and more details about the Flower configuration, refer to the :doc:`the Flower
    Configuration <ref-flower-configuration>` guide.

************
 Conclusion
************

You should now have learned how to generate self-signed certificates using the given
script, start a TLS-enabled server and have two clients establish secure connections to
it. You should also have learned how to run your Flower project using ``flwr run`` with
TLS enabled and how to secure internal Runtime API connections. All other commands in
the `Flower CLI <ref-api-cli.html>`_ will also be TLS-enabled.

.. note::

    Refer to the :doc:`docker/index` documentation to learn how to setup a federation
    where each component runs in its own Docker container. You can make use of TLS and
    other security features in Flower such as implement a SuperNode authentication
    mechanism.
